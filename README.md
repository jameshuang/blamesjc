Instructions: 
1) access the page, follow the page to install and enable CORS;
2) After you enabled CORS, refresh the complaint page;
3) if you see the red x as shown in the image below, click on it, then click on "Load Unsafe Script". The red X should go away.
4) customize your settings, and click File Complaints Now. That will start filing as well as save your settings.
5) you can always close the page and reopen it. But you may need to get rid of the red X again. 
6) CORS will stay as open. but I suggest you turn it off after you are done, and re-enable it when you file complaints again next time.

Some details: 
1) altitude: below 1000 - 8000feet
2) time window to complain: any time, before, after, before-or-after, between; 
3) up to complaints 1-100. That said, you can only file up to 100 complaints at a time.
4) flight time adjustment:  flight time (e.g. 07:35) is randomly adjusted to stay the same, to advance by 1 minute, or to delay by 1 minute (e.g. 07:34, 07:35, or 07:36). 
5) file the latest first, going backwards.
6) tracks flights that are already complained (to avoid duplicate filing); up to 1000 flights
7) user settings are saved (except # of complaints) and reused
